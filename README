*Overview*
This app is built off of the python-twitter app found here: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/.
It is meant as a simple wrapper for the api.  I have extended the python-twitter library to handle
pagination and more calls needed for the models.

For this app to work you also need to install python-oauth2 (http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2) as twitter uses this for all authentication.

*Api*
The simplist use of this would be to just include the api app.  That would allow you to simply dump twitter information into your database.

*Accounts*
The accounts app has a user profile that includes information about twitter and will return the api to use
for that user.

*Analysis*
This is really just here to help me with a project I am working on to link people interested in a given subject
to a location.  Feel free to use it or throw it out... up to you.

This django site should be fully functional if you just fill out the application_settings file (see example).

Obviously you will need to create a twitter app and add it to your twitter account.  See this awsome tutorial for help:
http://jeffmiller.github.com/2010/05/31/twitter-from-the-command-line-in-python-using-oauth
(Yea, yea, the tutorial is for tweepy, but the same principles apply to python-twitter as well...)

Good luck!
